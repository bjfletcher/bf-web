To get Watchify to work reliably, robustly and fast with Reactify and BrowserSync - by reliably, I mean where it would not crash or halt after any error occurs during React compilation, and by fast, I mean that it would only re-compile the bits that changed - known as incremental compilation.  Here's the Gulp task:

```js
gulp.task('scripts-watch', function() {
  bundler = watchify(bundler);
  bundler.on('update', function() {
      bundler.bundle()
        .on('error', function(e) { console.log(e.message); this.emit('end'); })
        .pipe(source('app.js'))
        .pipe(gulp.dest('./app/scripts/bundles'))
        .pipe(browserSync.reload({ stream: true }));
    });
});
```

The `.on('error', ...)` bit is key to prevent React compilation from crashing the watch.  The `browserSync.reload` will reload the page on all open browser tabs.

The `server` task is as follows:

```js
gulp.task('serve', ['styles', 'lib', 'scripts', 'scripts-watch'], function () {
  browserSync({
    notify: false,
    logPrefix: 'BF', // short for BenFletcher.com
    server: ['.tmp', 'app']
  });

  gulp.watch(['app/**/*.html'], browserSync.reload);
  gulp.watch(['app/styles/**/*.{scss,css}'], ['styles', browserSync.reload]);
  gulp.watch(['app/images/**/*'], browserSync.reload);
});
```

Hope it helps. You may wonder why I'm using Watchify, the reason is simple: Watchify has incremental compilation support meaning it will only compile things that have changed.

I noticed that there wasn't a CDN for React Router as I was on a mission to get all the common libraries on CDN in a project.  So I wrote script where CDNJS would automatically add any new ReactJS versions to CDNJS.

Happily, the React Router and the CDNJS people were happy with the pull requests to accomplish this and to add to documentation about this.

GitHub Pull Requests:

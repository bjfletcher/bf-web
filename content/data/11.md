I didn't see anything on Stack Overflow or the Internet that worked and I hope this would help if anyone was looking for something.

I used the "offline" pattern because I wanted to allow users to upload to a single YouTube account that I had setup for the website.

Three to this process:

1. site would need to authenticate with Googlbe, obtain the OAuth2 access and especially refresh tokens, and store these in database;
2. whenever user wants to upload a video, site would need to:
a) check if the access token from 1 has expired, if it has, obtain a new one using the refresh token (won't need any re-authentication);
b) with the access token, upload the video to YouTube

To do 1, an admin page signs in to YouTube to obtain an authentication code:

```
  def signInUrl: String = {
    val state = UUID.randomUUID()
    val parameters = Map(
        "client_id" -> clientId,
        "redirect_uri" -> redirectUri,
        "scope" -> "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload",
        "response_type" -> "code",
        "state" -> state,
        "access_type" -> "offline")
    val queryString = parameters.map(p => s"${p._1}=${p._2}").mkString("&")
    s"$authUrl?$queryString"
  }
```

Then obtain the OAuth2 access and refresh tokens using the code from above:

```
  def newTokens(code: String): Future[Tokens] = {
    for {
      accessResponse <- WS.url(tokenUrl)
        .post(Map("client_id" -> Seq(clientId),
            "client_secret" -> Seq(clientSecret),
            "grant_type" -> Seq("authorization_code"),
            "code" -> Seq(code),
            "redirect_uri" -> Seq(redirectUri)))
    } yield {
      // TODO: the below is for the offline pattern...
      // for online, we'd add it to user's request object
      println(s"New tokens JSON: ${accessResponse.json}")
      val tokens = accessResponse.json.as[Tokens]
      println(s"New tokens: $tokens")
      // TODO: use database instead of a variable here?
      this.tokens = Some(tokens)
      tokens
    }
  }
```

Store the access, expires and refresh tokens to database.

To do 2(a), the upload page checks if the access token has expired and refresh it if necessary:

```
  def refreshToken(tokens: Tokens): Future[Tokens] = {
    if (tokens.expires.getTime > System.currentTimeMillis()) {
      Future.successful(tokens)
    } else {
      for {
        r <- WS.url(tokenUrl)
          .post(Map("client_id" -> Seq(clientId),
          "client_secret" -> Seq(clientSecret),
          "grant_type" -> Seq("refresh_token"),
          "refresh_token" -> Seq(tokens.refreshToken.get)))
      } yield {
        r.json.as[Tokens]
      }
    }
  }
```

To do 2(b), upload video with the access token, using YouTube's two-part process of firstly obtaining the URL to upload to and then uploading to the URL:

```
  def upload(video: File, details: VideoDetails): Future[JsValue] = {
    for {
      // NOTE: using stored tokens for the offline pattern...
      // for online pattern, we'd get it from user's request object
      tokens <- refreshToken(this.tokens.get)
      upload <- WS.url(uploadUrl)
        .withHeaders("Authorization" -> s"Bearer ${tokens.accessToken}")
        .withQueryString("uploadType" -> "resumable", "part" -> "status, snippet")
        .post(Json.obj(
            "snippet" -> Json.obj(
              "title" -> details.title,
              "description" -> details.description
            ),
            "status" -> Json.obj(
              "privacyStatus" -> "private"
            )))
      location = upload.header("location").get
      meta <- WS.url(location)
        .withHeaders("Authorization" -> s"Bearer ${tokens.accessToken}")
        .post(video)
    } yield {
      this.tokens = Some(tokens)
      meta.json
    }
  }
```

Hope this helps.

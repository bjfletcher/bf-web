Jest is another testing framework, from Facebook, and one that I've found very interesting.  Particularly in how it handles dependencies and the mocking of them for cleaner TDD code.

I needed to test some complicated OAuth2 code that had a large dependency tree with thanks to the Passport library and noticed that Jest could not mock this well.

I created a simple test case:

and corresponding issue that I raised on Jest:

https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/199

Turned out that we'd need to be smarter about how the dependencies work and they can't be automatically mocked out of the box.  Still, I'm well impressed and hope that Jest will get better and better.

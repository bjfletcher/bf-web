For any non-React client-side project, I'd use [Browserify](http://browserify.org/).  For React projects, after having used both, I'd use [Webpack](https://github.com/webpack/webpack).  This is for two reasons:

- Webpack's got [React Hot Loader](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader), which has the advantage over BrowserSync in that it will compile and update *only* the bits that have changed on the webpage.  Only disadvantage is that it won't reload all browsers that I've got open to the same address like BrowserSync does.
- Webpack's got better bundling support.  I need only a few lines in configuration to tell it to bundle a module or two in a separate bundle and it's worked much more reliably than the plugins that I've tried with Browserify.

If I could change two things about this, it would be for React Hot Loader to work with BrowserSync and for Webpack to be more "mainstream" like Browserify.  Despite all these, the two benefits I mentioned above gives Webpack the edge IMHO.

I came across a [question on Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/27612765/nested-routes-in-react-router/27670456#27670456) about nested routes in React Router.  Here's my attempt at explaining it (if you have any more questions about this, feel free to ask in the Stack Overflow. :):

The configuration isn't about the routing (despite the name) but more about the layouts driven by paths.

So, with this configuration:

```jsx
<Route name="dashboard" handler={availableRoutes.Dashboard}>
  <Route name="dashboard-child" handler={availableRoutes.DashboardChild} />
</Route>
```

It is saying that dashboard-child is to be embedded inside dashboard. How this works is that if dashboard has something like this:

`<div><h1>Dashboard</h1><RouteHandler /></div>`

and dashboard-child has:

`<h2>I'm a child of dashboard.</h2>`

Then for the path dashboard there is no embedded child due to no matching path, resulting in this:

`<div><h1>Dashboard</h1></div>`

And for the path dashboard/dashboard-child the embedded child has a matching path, resulting in this:

`<div><h1>Dashboard</h1><h2>I'm a child of dashboard.</h2></div>`

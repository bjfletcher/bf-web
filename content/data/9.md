React Hot Loader is a great utility to allow us to keep current page in browser, including any memory state, as is and update just the bits that have been changed.

I noticed that React Hot Loader doesn't work if React is external such as being on CDN.  I started a discussion about this on GitHub and to my delight, the developer was onboard and soon turned out that some others wanted the same capability.

See [here](https://github.com/gaearon/react-hot-loader/issues/53#issuecomment-68489534) for the GitHub discussion including solution.

Some people find it surprising that [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) uses JSX.  Here's my thoughts on why JSX is good.  In some projects that I've been in, the separation of concerns between JS and HTML has been interesting.  Especially when there's a lot of dynamicism to the page.  This was one reason why I didn't like server-side rendering in the past with JSP, PHP and the like.

React has however changed my view on that.

React manages to continue and keep JS and HTML separate but close to each other enough.  It keeps all the logic in one place yet it keeps the JS and HTMl neatly separated.  The best bit is that the binding between the two is so very simple and not at all hairy.  React goes by similar principles as the Flux architecture in that it encourages the unidirectional data flow mindset over the bidirectional ones (e.g., AngularJS).  As a result, the design of the building blocks of the page is enforced to be clearer and easier to extend.

The performance using virtual/shadow DOM is also very impressive.  If we follow the rules, React will cause actual "paint reloads" only if they're absolutely necessary.

Do give it a go.  Especially if, like me, you used Dojo in the distant past and the many different MV* architectures. :)
